Why is the mean–variance (MV) objective function
$$
\max_w \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\mu} - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}
$$
a valid *approximation* of investor preferences?

Here is one justification of the Mean-Variance optimization problem using the Taylor Series Approximation. Refer to @levy_markowitz1979mv_utility for more on this topic.

### The Goal
We start with an investor who wants to maximize the expected utility of their final wealth, $E[U(W)]$. We want to show that it can be approxmiated by the optimization problem: $\max_w \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\mu} - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}$.


### Step 1: The Setup
Let

* $W$ be the random variable representing final wealth
* $\mu_W = E[W]$ be the expected final wealth
* $\sigma^2_W = E[(W - \mu_W)^2]$ be the variance of final wealth
* $U(W)$ be a utility function where $U'>0$ (more wealth is good) and $U''<0$ (risk aversion)

We define the *Certainty Equivalent (CE)*, the guaranteed cash amount that provides the same utility as the risky wealth $W$.
$$U(CE) = E[U(W)]$$

*Since utility increases with wealth, maximizing Expected Utility is equivalent to maximizing the Certainty Equivalent (CE).*


### Step 2: Approximating the "Risky" Side ($E[U(W)]$)
We approximate the utility of the random wealth $W$ using a second-order Taylor Series expansion around the expected wealth $\mu_W$.

$$U(W) \approx U(\mu_W) + U'(\mu_W)(W - \mu_W) + \frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)(W - \mu_W)^2$$

Now, we apply the expectation operator $E[\cdot]$ to the entire equation:

$$E[U(W)] \approx E[U(\mu_W)] + E[U'(\mu_W)(W - \mu_W)] + E\left[\frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)(W - \mu_W)^2\right]$$

Since $\mu_W$, $U(\mu_W)$, and its derivatives are constants, they move outside the expectation:

$$E[U(W)] \approx U(\mu_W) + U'(\mu_W)\underbrace{E[W - \mu_W]}_{0} + \frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)\underbrace{E[(W - \mu_W)^2]}_{\sigma^2_W}$$

*Note: The middle term is zero because the expected deviation from the mean is always zero.*

**Result A:**
$$E[U(W)] \approx U(\mu_W) + \frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)\sigma^2_W$$


### Step 3: Approximating the "Certainty" Side ($U(CE)$)
We also approximate the utility of the Certainty Equivalent $CE$. We expand this around $\mu_W$ as well. (This is valid assuming the risk premium is small, so $CE$ is close to $\mu_W$).

$$U(CE) \approx U(\mu_W) + U'(\mu_W)(CE - \mu_W)$$

*(We stop at the first order here because $CE$ is a deterministic constant, not a random variable, and we assume the difference $(CE-\mu_W)$ is small enough that the squared term is negligible.)*

**Result B:**
$$U(CE) \approx U(\mu_W) + U'(\mu_W)(CE - \mu_W)$$


### Step 4: Equating and Solving for CE
Recall our definition: $U(CE) = E[U(W)]$. Therefore, **Result A = Result B**.

$$U(\mu_W) + U'(\mu_W)(CE - \mu_W) \approx U(\mu_W) + \frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)\sigma^2_W$$

Subtract $U(\mu_W)$ from both sides:

$$U'(\mu_W)(CE - \mu_W) \approx \frac{1}{2}U''(\mu_W)\sigma^2_W$$

Divide by $U'(\mu_W)$ to isolate $CE$:

$$CE - \mu_W \approx \frac{1}{2} \frac{U''(\mu_W)}{U'(\mu_W)} \sigma^2_W$$

$$CE \approx \mu_W + \frac{1}{2} \frac{U''(\mu_W)}{U'(\mu_W)} \sigma^2_W$$


### Step 5: Introducing the Risk Aversion Parameter
We substitute the *Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion*, defined as $A = -\frac{U''(\mu_W)}{U'(\mu_W)}$.

$$CE \approx \mu_W - \frac{1}{2} A \sigma^2_W$$


### Step 6: Converting Wealth to Portfolio Returns
The equation above is in terms of *wealth*. We must convert it to *portfolio returns*.

Let $W_0$ be initial wealth and $R_p$ be the random portfolio return with mean $\mu_p$ and variance $\sigma^2_p$. Final wealth is: $W = W_0(1 + R_p)$. We can compute the mean and variance of final wealth $W$:

1.  *Mean:* $\mu_W = W_0(1 + \mu_p) = W_0 + W_0 \mu_p$
2.  *Variance:* $\sigma^2_W = W_0^2 \sigma^2_p$

Substitute these into the CE equation:

$$CE \approx (W_0 + W_0 \mu_p) - \frac{1}{2} A (W_0^2 \sigma^2_p)$$


### Step 7: The Final Optimization
The investor wants to maximize $CE$.
In an optimization problem, we can remove additive constants ($W_0$) and divide by positive constants ($W_0$) without changing the location of the maximum.

1.  Maximize CE:
    $$\max \left[ W_0 + W_0 \mu_p - \frac{1}{2} A W_0^2 \sigma^2_p \right]$$

2.  Remove additive constant $W_0$:
    $$\max \left[ W_0 \mu_p - \frac{1}{2} A W_0^2 \sigma^2_p \right]$$

3.  Divide by scaling factor $W_0$:
    $$\max \left[ \mu_p - \frac{1}{2} (A \cdot W_0) \sigma^2_p \right]$$

4.  Define Relative Risk Aversion ($\gamma$):
    We define $\gamma = A \cdot W_0$. This is the coefficient of *Relative Risk Aversion*.

5.  Substitute Vector Notation: $\mu_p = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\mu}$ and $\sigma^2_p = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}$

We arrive at the final optimization problem:

$$\max_{\mathbf{w}} \quad \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\mu} - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}$$
